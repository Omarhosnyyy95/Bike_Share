# Brief
This project is to explore the bicycle-share system within 3 major states in the United States- Chicago, New York City, and Washington based on the data provided by divvybikes.com, citibikenyc.com and capitalbikeshare.com for the first 6 months in 2017. This project is a part of the Data Analysis Professional track on Udacity. Therefore, data wrangling was performed by Udacity to simplify the process and 3 .csv files containing the required data for each city in a more organized form were provided.

# Dependencies
* Python 3
* Numpy
* Pandas

# Information required from the dataset
* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* trip duration
* user info

# How to use it
the user interface gives the user the ability to filter the data and then the program generates the required information based on the user filtering.
